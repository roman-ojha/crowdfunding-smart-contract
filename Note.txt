*) CrowdFunding:

    *) Smart Contract Design:
        -> Contributors:

        -> Manager:
            -> Target:
                -> how much money is need to do project
            -> Deadline:
                -> how much time do we have for that project
            -> minContribution:
                -> minimum money required to contribution
            -> manager need to take a permission from the contribution if he/she want to get those contributed ether from start contract
        -> if < 50% of contributors allow only then manager can be able to get those ether
        -> if the targeted money didn't get fulfilled on a Deadline then contributors will get there money back
